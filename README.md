# FrannHammer
Full stack web site, rest api and database layer for Sm4sh frame data as told by KuroganeHammer.

This is being worked on with KuroganeHammer's permission.  All credit for the actual data that is stored and retrieved goes to him and 
any other people that are involved in that process.

Allows consumers to pull back the data displayed on KuroganeHammer's site as JSON.  The data is stored in a database and is not 
scraped from the site on-call.  Since the api is still in heavy development, all requests require credentials.  If you are interested 
in using the API, send me an email at the address located on my github profile (Frannsoft) and I'll get you started.

See the wiki for more information.
