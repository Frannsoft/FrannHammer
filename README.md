Develop: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ruxmxhiutxe9q8v9/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Frannsoft/frannhammer-0uqqq/branch/develop)

Full stack web site, rest api and database layer for Sm4sh frame data as told by KuroganeHammer.

This is being worked on with KuroganeHammer's permission.  All credit for the actual data that is stored and retrieved goes to him and 
any other people that are involved in that process.

Allows consumers to pull back the data displayed on KuroganeHammer's site as JSON.  The data is stored in a database and is not 
scraped from the site on-call.

See the wiki for more information.
