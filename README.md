Restful api and database layer for Super Smash Bros. 4 and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate frame data as told by @KuroganeHammer.

This is being worked on with @KuroganeHammer's permission.  All credit for the actual data that is stored and retrieved goes to him and 
any other people that are involved in that process.

Allows consumers to pull back the data displayed on @KuroganeHammer's site as JSON.  The data is stored in a database and is not 
scraped from the site on-call.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer/wiki) for more information.

## Getting Started

Live API documentation can be found via [Swagger docs](http://beta-api-kuroganehammer.azurewebsites.net/swagger/ui/index).  

A good place to get started is the [Character Data page](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer/wiki/Character-Data).

### API Features

This allows consumers to pull back the following types of data from the existing KuroganeHammer site:

- Character details such as image links, color theme from KuroganeHammer.com, descriptions, etc.
- Movement details such as Weight, Fall Speed, Walk Speed, etc.
- Move details such as active Hitboxes, First Actionable frames, Knockback Growth, etc.
- Character attribute data such as Gravity, Dash speed, Air Acceleration, etc.

To see more details on these features, check out these wiki pages:

- [Character Attribute Data](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer/wiki/Character-Attribute-Data)
- [Throw Data](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer/wiki/Throw-Data)

The live docs (above) are a great place to see the full capability and how one can use it.

##### NOTE: The API is in beta and is subject to rapid change.
